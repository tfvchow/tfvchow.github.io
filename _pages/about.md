Vincent Chow is a research assistant professor at the Department of Logistics and Maritime Studies of PolyU. He received his PhD and MPhil in Systems Engineering and Engineering Management and BSc in Statistics from [the Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk) (CUHK) in 2021, 2018, and 2016, respectively. Prior to joining PolyU, he was a postdoctoral fellow at CUHK.

He is interested in the development and applications of distributionally robust optimization, under the paradigm of optimization under uncertainty.

Applications considered in his work include surgery blocks allocation in [https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-60212-3 healthcare], manpower (re)allocation in [https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4899-7571-3 public transit], and [https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-32177-2 facility location problems].

He is constantly looking for ways that operations management, deep learning, and statistics can go together. In particular, his current research involves [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2022.102712 the use of reinforcement learning in combinatorial problems] which are notoriously hard to optimize.
